### ATDD: Roadmap

* Describe the feature
* Write failing acceptance (or functional) test
* Write failing unit (or integration) test for it
* Implement features until all unit tests pass
* Implement feature until acceptance tests pass

---

### Why ATDD

* Start from the outer test which is not bound to implementation
* Never commit a feature which is not ready yet
